## why use OOP
-Object-oriented programming (OOP) in JavaScript offers several benefits, and its use can make code more organized, reusable, and easier to maintain. Here are some reasons why OOP is commonly used in JavaScript:

1. **Encapsulation:** OOP allows you to encapsulate the implementation details of an object within a class. This helps in hiding the internal complexities and exposing only what is necessary. This improves code readability and reduces the chances of unintended interference with the internal state of an object.

2. **Abstraction:** OOP promotes the concept of abstraction, where you can model real-world entities as objects with their own properties and behaviors. This makes it easier to understand and work with complex systems by focusing on high-level structures and interactions.

3. **Reuse of Code:** OOP encourages the reuse of code through concepts like inheritance and composition. Inheritance allows you to create a new class based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and methods. Composition involves creating objects that are composed of other objects, promoting a modular and reusable code structure.

4. **Modularity:** OOP supports the creation of modular code, where each class or object represents a distinct module. This modular structure makes it easier to understand, maintain, and update different parts of the codebase without affecting the entire system.

5. **Ease of Maintenance:** OOP can make code easier to maintain over time. Changes to one part of the code are less likely to affect other parts if proper encapsulation and abstraction are used. This makes it easier to add new features, fix bugs, or make improvements without causing unintended side effects.

6. **Code Organization:** OOP provides a natural way to organize code. Classes and objects map well to real-world entities and their interactions, making it easier to structure and manage large codebases.

7. **Prototypal Inheritance:** In JavaScript, which is a prototype-based language, OOP allows you to use prototypal inheritance. This feature enables objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects, providing a flexible way to create relationships between objects.

While OOP in JavaScript is optional, and you can certainly write functional or procedural code, adopting OOP principles can be beneficial in certain scenarios, especially for larger and more complex applications. It helps in creating maintainable, scalable, and organized code.
